Simple code that takes file name as input, and creates a csv file with action units.

For this file to work you have to install docker, change file paths and download OpenFace library, where you have to run ,,download_models.ps1" in the powershell.

The OpenFace folder should be in the same folder as the project files.

This folder is not committed on github as the files are too big.
